For a hash function, assume that keys are INTEGERS with a fixed key size of 100 characters.

The code is C++, and the keys are std::strings. Do not use std::hash. Assume you do not need to assert key format.

Produce an optimized hash function for this specific case with an unrolled for loop, and also consider that the constant character is always the same and in the same position.

Certainly! For a hash function that takes integer keys with a fixed size of 100 characters, and the keys are represented as std::strings in C++, you can create a custom hash function. In this example, I'll assume that the constant character is always at position 42 in the string. Below is a simple example of an optimized hash function with an unrolled for loop:

cpp
Copy code
#include <string>

std::size_t customHash(const std::string& key) {
    constexpr std::size_t keySize = 100;
    constexpr std::size_t unrollFactor = 10; // Unroll the loop by a factor of 10 for optimization

    std::size_t hashValue = 0;

    // Unrolled loop for better performance
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < keySize; i += unrollFactor) {
        hashValue ^= (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i]) << 7) ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 1]) << 14)
                   ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 2]) << 21) ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 3]) << 28)
                   ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 4]) << 35) ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 5]) << 42)
                   ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 6]) << 49) ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 7]) << 56)
                   ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 8]) << 63) ^ (static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i + 9]) << 70);
    }

    // Handle the remaining characters in the key (if any)
    for (std::size_t i = (keySize / unrollFactor) * unrollFactor; i < keySize; ++i) {
        hashValue ^= static_cast<std::size_t>(key[i]) << ((i % unrollFactor) * 7);
    }

    return hashValue;
}

int main() {
    std::string key = "0123456789"; // Replace with your actual key

    std::size_t hashValue = customHash(key);

    // Use hashValue as needed
    return 0;
}
This example unrolls the loop by a factor of 10, and the XOR operations help combine the hash values of individual characters. You can adjust the unroll factor based on your specific requirements and experiment to find the optimal value for your use case.
