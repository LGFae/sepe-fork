## Introduction

The goal of this project is to devise, implement, and evaluate techniques for generating optimized hash functions tailored for string keys whose format can be approximated by a regular expression inferred through profiling. These functions will be used to improve the performance of C++'s STL data structures, such as `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multimap` and `std::unordered_multiset`, in addition to any other `std::hash` specialization for user-defined C++ types.
